<p>When it comes to getting your voice heard by Congress, it is often said that an in-person visit to your member of Congress, is as influential as 10 calls to their office, or 100 written letters, or 1,000 emails.  </p>

<p>While visiting your elected officials is not always feasible, picking up the phone and giving them a call is very easy to do.  However, many people resort to emails, or even worse, doing nothing despite deeply caring about an issue.</p>

<p>This project makes is easy for an advocacy organization to quickly and easily launch a call campaign among a large member base on a specific set of designated issues.  Using this app, you can enable your audience to easily identify their member of the House or Senate, and be connected with them via phone by them simply clicking a button in their web browser.</p>

<pre><code>$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name
$ git fetch origin
$ git checkout gh-pages
</code></pre>

<p>If you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.</p>

<p>We've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.</p>

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>
